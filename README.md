# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This is where I'll be solving the daily challenges and sharing my solutions.

## Programming Language

All days are done in JavaScript

## How To Run

Run the main.js file using `node .`, and select the day from the prompt using the arrow keys.

## Status

The last time I did Advent of Code was in 2023, where I earned 39 total stars. This year, I'm aiming for all 50.

So far, I have completed all Parts up to Day 4 (the current day).
